00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
8

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
See ya

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm all in here

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Why not get value for me?

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She's laughing man, put it in the car

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just follow her

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Fuck she wants me to call

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Take it

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Everyone is very happy to see the beauty of the show

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
See ya is here

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We are here to see how she is doing in the middle of the Haasler

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
She is doing well in the middle of the Haasler

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Before the video starts, I want to thank everyone for support

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I only paid 20% of my channel in a month

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now this book is over 25%

19

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the future, I will start with Dougal Open

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the following video,during some red sculpture, Order Astralıyor

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,500
300

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:18,920
It is the only four

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,160
From the beginning, the Astralıyor Event 2,000

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,340
als in the haasler

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,320
look at that

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,160
quote

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,240
it's it

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,960
what Ju?

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,260
九 Polish

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,300
I'm so sick

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,140
I'm so sick

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Catch two aces.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
Two times.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
One time, go with it.

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,140
Two times.

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
You have no idea.

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,140
She just said we must have an egg.

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,140
That's so sick.

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,140
That is not nice.

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,140
No sign.

44
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,140
No sign.

45
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,140
That is the last one.

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
That's pretty sick.

47
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,140
I mean, it's such a big swing.

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,140
Instead of Dr. P winning,

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,140
a 24-hour...

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,140
I haven't been to Germany for a long time.

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,140
I've been in the jungle for eight or nine days.

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,140
I'm not sure how many people eat this.

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,140
But if you have a big advantage,

54
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,140
you can put some food in your mouth.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
And they will play very well.

56
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140
This is exciting, guys.

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,140
Nituchi is playing a hand.

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,140
It's something old, man.

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I think I did it.

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
You ate it, Mr.

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Don't worry about it.

62
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,140
Crazy Drew, man.

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,140
What a flop for him.

64
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Chop pear and a flush drop.

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,140
After the flip,

66
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,140
the big tree of the ship came out of the main cave.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Just like a nice marsh.

68
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,140
He was selling a pair of people to help him.

69
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,140
到了 Sierra,

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,140
if he comes in,

71
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,140
because he may have an ice-cream,

72
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,140
then there will be some anti-spatial rules.

73
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,140
After the ball,

74
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,140
the ball will be given to Gao.

75
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Because he is playing,

76
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
that's not a problem.

77
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,140
But this ball is not very good.

78
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
If you have a short leg,

79
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,140
you still hope that you can play with a-go-k-9.

80
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
These are more than high-pitched.

81
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,140
If you have a Queen X,

82
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
X0,

83
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,140
your A-s are all bad.

84
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,140
It's not good to have a ball.

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
It's bad shape.

86
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,140
The ball is again developed.

87
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
Very lucky.

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,140
She specifically needed a jack that was not a club.

89
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
And of course,

90
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
what comes in turn?

91
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,140
A jack that's not a club.

92
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,140
They do max it too much.

93
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,140
They know what max it is.

94
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,140
They beat half of it.

95
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,140
I'm a little bit over the max.

96
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140
How does that happen?

97
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,140
It's still so many games.

98
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,140
Yeah.

99
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,140
Never met like a one-of-a-one.

100
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
Now I kind of won't go.

101
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,140
Really?

102
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Yeah.

103
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
I'll fucking lose here.

104
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
I'm gonna sit here and tell me how.

105
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
Three thousand.

106
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,140
I know it's the idea.

107
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
Crazy Drew makes the call.

108
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm looking for a club.

109
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Ciyah, you're home.

110
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,140
Ciyah, you're home.

111
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,140
I like this one very much.

112
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Because the one who saw it was a player from the team

113
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,140
was the most important player.

114
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,140
When facing a player from the team,

115
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,140
the main purpose of the game was to get a jack.

116
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,140
Especially in this very young world,

117
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
there are many players who can get a jack.

118
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
There's no problem with the game.

119
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,140
The team also sent a good response to the team.

120
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,140
They gave him three balls.

121
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Ciyah, you're holding it again.

122
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Next, the next game.

123
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,140
The big number of players who just lost

124
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
is getting Aces.

125
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Ciyah is following the team.

126
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Ciyah is in the dressing room.

127
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,140
He can't go to the dressing room.

128
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,140
The team has two teams.

129
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Aces is Ceybye's 800.

130
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,140
There are two people who watch Ciyah.

131
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,140
They think they'll give their own life to the rest of the team.

132
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
So I want to get a little help.

133
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm going to add that.

134
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,140
The team also took the good performance

135
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
and got a good score.

136
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
They don't have any problems.

137
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
The person who is still alive

138
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
took the ball to the pitch.

139
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Aces is following the team.

140
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Aces is going to win.

141
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Aces is going to win.

142
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Ceybye's performance

143
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,140
might be a very bad thing to do.

144
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
I don't know what to do.

145
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
I can't do that.

146
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,140
We never get away from it.

147
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,140
I'm just a PingGan.

148
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,140
Ceybye is going to win.

149
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
DGF is going to win.

150
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Ceybye is going to win.

151
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
DGF is going to win.

152
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Ceybye is going to win.

153
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
Ceybye is going to win.

154
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Ceybye is going to win.

155
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Ceybye is going to win.

156
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
$19,860 in the pot.

157
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Here's the river.

158
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
He's going to win.

159
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,140
And he just played the big tree.

160
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
I don't need to pick up the tree.

161
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
This is only a small village.

162
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Oyin.

163
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,140
This might be a small village.

164
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,140
Hey, Ceybye is at home.

165
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,140
There's nothing to lose here.

166
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,140
I don't know.

167
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Ceybye is going to win.

168
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,140
Ceybye is going to win.

169
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,140
I mean, he's shorter than this.

170
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Yeah, he doesn't have any more.

171
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Uncle is very injured.

172
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,140
I thought he's more than me.

173
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
25,000 dollars swing in six hands.

174
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
Oh, yeah.

175
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
That's magic.

176
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
That's magic. I'm done.

177
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,140
Crazy.

178
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Today, we didn't have to worry about playing.

179
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
We'll go back to rest.

180
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,140
Unfortunately, we didn't have to worry about playing.

181
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Let's see the next episode.

182
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140
A-go player.

183
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,140
The next five people.

184
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,140
The other players didn't have three hundred.

185
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,140
So, they have four A-4 and three.

186
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
Almost no one has a strong card.

187
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,140
No ASK and ASK, no A-3 and ASK.

188
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
A-go already has a strong card.

189
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,140
C-Bat.

190
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,140
We can see that only the black and white players

191
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
have a strong middle-ish character.

192
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,140
This player, Bair, is also a player who can be self-conscious.

193
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,140
The previous Live Fight Bike was also a fixed place.

194
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,140
It was very easy.

195
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I love Throughout You game.

196
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Many users reload online.

197
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,140
lived and asked for service's capabilities

198
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,140
while I played taking 一 now and later.

199
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
This pouquinho nah nah.

200
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:45,440
M необходeresly

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,140
so they can't neglect them to free one completely.

202
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,800
Also I didn't automatically use the most attractive of the team

203
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,380
I've been usingентly twice for the quality

204
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,620
I asked some people to think they could outsmart instead of Planet Bluff

205
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,140
so when they practice twice

206
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,260
When stepping aside

207
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,000
They willemandue hard fromly

208
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,180
I am AI

209
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,340
I have got some ones for the construction

210
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,220
the characters are well enough

211
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
She's on tilt.

212
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Maybe bear is making her a call.

213
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
She's blocking.

214
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,140
Nice chance to see her.

215
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,140
She's got King Jack.

216
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
What do you have?

217
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
Nothing I tell you.

218
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Just follow her.

219
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Fuck she wants me to call.

220
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:46,820
She's got King Jack bear, so you know it.

221
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
She picked up diamonds on the turn, break out on the river.

222
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
She's steaming.

223
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Peter just showed her a blow.

224
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Take it.

225
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Yes.

226
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Oh, she's got D.A.

227
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Damn it.

228
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
The team really thought about it for a long time.

229
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
The second team caught a chicken.

230
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
One-five of the top four players, Siyah,

231
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
is the main player of a financial crisis.

232
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Before the next game,

233
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
if you want to join my team,

234
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
you can find the team's team

235
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
in the capital of the next game.

236
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Welcome to the new team.

237
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
It's going too fast right now.

238
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Siyah is in the second round.

239
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Mindy the dog.

240
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
It's a dog game nuisance.

241
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Really?

242
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Okay.

243
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Mia and LeBron.

244
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
They were beaten up by three or four people.

245
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
They really didn't want to.

246
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
The second team was beaten up by Baird.

247
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Siyah was beaten up by three people.

248
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
He just three-baked with four-three off.

249
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I'll take it out against the machine.

250
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
I'm going to grab my raise.

251
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Ready?

252
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Yeah, pretty much.

253
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Two-colders are going to call him.

254
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Might've been better.

255
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
The team was beaten up by three people.

256
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Straight flush draw.

257
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Peter's got bottom pair.

258
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Baird you has withed.

259
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
Siyah's got half-fault.

260
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Deep and imposition.

261
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Siyah's got a lot of points.

262
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
The most action-oriented team was beaten up by Siyah.

263
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
They beat both of them.

264
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
They gave Siyah a shot.

265
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Another cooler situation.

266
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Five more.

267
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
The team was beaten up by five-four-three.

268
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Two people were beaten up by three people.

269
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
They probably got the most hit.

270
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
She's a little concerned.

271
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,820
She's got six-seven, but not very concerned.

272
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Seven-seven.

273
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Seven-seven more.

274
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Can you get away somehow?

275
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Siyah, go ahead.

276
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Three-three more.

277
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:04,820
When someone raised this to 17k in the 10-20-40 game.

278
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
The rest of the players...

279
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
She's silent.

280
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
If Peter is here,

281
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
he can only get a few thousand.

282
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
So he's not only playing in the O-Yin,

283
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
but also playing in the O-Yin.

284
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I'm literally tilted because I'm being 100% serious.

285
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
You think I'm kidding? I'm zero kidding.

286
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
Zero kidding.

287
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Peter plays five.

288
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Oh no.

289
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
The last one was pushed.

290
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
But there are four more.

291
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
$65,000 pot.

292
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Maybe I'm dead.

293
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Siyah...

294
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,820
He's got outspoken.

295
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Nice hands here.

296
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Siyah, you're an animal.

297
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I love it.

298
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
That way you can fight in New York really happy.

299
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
That one goes to Siyah.

300
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
You're getting a really good flight now.

301
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Siyah, Siyah, you're a good flight now.

302
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Let's see if you can see me.

303
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I can't get out.

304
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Siyah, you're going to have a big meal next time.

305
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I'll see you in the next video.

306
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
